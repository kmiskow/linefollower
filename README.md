# linefollower

## Description

A small mobile robot with purpose of driving along a line using STM32 Nucleo board.

The used battery turned out to be too weak, as a result of which the robot moved very slowly in wireless mode. The robot`s controls were working correctly, the sensors detected the lines well, and the drive system allowed it to stay on the line even during sharp turns.
